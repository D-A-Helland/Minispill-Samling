# Web Development School Project

This repository contains a school project made for a Norwegian course assignment.  
All documentation and comments are written in Norwegian because the project was delivered as part of the course requirements.

The project includes a simple website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on an Apache server and managed with Git and GitHub.
